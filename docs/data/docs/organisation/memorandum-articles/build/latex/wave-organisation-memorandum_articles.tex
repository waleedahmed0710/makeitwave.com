\section{Decisionmaking by Directors}
\label{\detokenize{content:decisionmaking-by-directors}}
Directors To Take Decisions Collectively

The general rule about decisionmaking by directors is that any decision of the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a decision taken in accordance with article 8

If

the company only has one director, and
no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director, the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the articles relating to directors’ decisionmaking.
Unanimous Decisions
A decision of

Shares and Distribution
Shares
Decision-Making by Shareholders
Administrative Arrangements
Directors’ Indemnity and Insurance
Company Seal
Any common seal may only be used by the authority of the directors.

The directors may decide by what means and in what form any common seal is to be used

Unless otherwise decided by the directors, if the company has a common seal and it is affixed to a document, the document must also be signed by at least one authorised person in the presence of a witness who attests the signature

For the purposes of this article, an authorised person is:

any director of the company;
the company secretary (if any); or
any person authorised by the directors for the purpose of signing documents to which the common seal is applied.
No right to inspect accounts and other records
Except as provided by law or authorised by the directors or an ordinary resolution of the company, no person is entitled to inspect any of the company’s accounting or other records or documents merely by virtue of being a shareholder.

Provision for employees on cessation of business
The directors may decide to make provision for the benefit of persons employed or formerly employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries (other than a director or former director or shadow director) in connection with the cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of the undertaking of the company or that subsidiary.

Indemnity

Subject to paragraph (2), a relevant director of the company or an associated company may be indemnified out of the company’s assets against:

any liability incurred by that director in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company or an associated company,
any liability incurred by that director in connection with the activities of the company or an associated company in its capacity as a trustee of an occupational pension scheme (as defined in section 235(6) of the Companies Act 2006),
any other liability incurred by that director as an officer of the company or an associated company.
