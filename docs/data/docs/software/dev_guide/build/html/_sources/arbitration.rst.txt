Arbitration
======================================================

(a) The parties agree that any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  ("AAA"), with judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator to be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the then-current specified Commercial Arbitration Rules, the following shall apply with respect to the arbitration proceeding: (i) the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by one arbitrator selected by the parties, provided if the parties fail to make such designation within five days after receipt by the AAA of any demand for arbitration, the AAA shall make the appointment in its sole discretion; (ii) the existence, subject, evidence, proceedings, and ruling resulting from the arbitration proceedings shall be deemed confidential information, and shall not be disclosed by either party, their representatives, or the arbitrator (except: (a) to the Professional advisers of Company or Distributor; (b) in connection with a public offering of securities by Company or Distributor; (c) as ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) as required to comply with any applicable governmental statute or regulation); (iii) the arbitrator shall be required to prepare written findings of fact; and (iv) the arbitrator may grant any relief or remedy which the arbitrator deems just and equitable provided, however, that the arbitrator shall have no authority to, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms, limitations and conditions of this Agreement.

(b)	Each party to the arbitration is to pay an equal part of the deposit fixed by the AAA. Notwithstanding the determination of the arbitrator (i) all costs associated with the arbitration and imposed by the AAA or the arbitrator shall be borne equally by each party to the arbitration, and (ii) each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for its own attorneys' fees and other Professional fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. Determinations of such arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the Country of Great Britain without giving effect to its conflict of law rules. All proceedings before the arbitrator shall be conducted in the English language.
