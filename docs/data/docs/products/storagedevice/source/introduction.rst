**Key Factors about the Home Hub™:** 

	• Primarily a Wi-Fi Hotspot
	• Connects to existing Internet Router (ethernet port & cable) 
	• Works independantly or with enhancement products and/or accessories
	• Functions most effectively when all wireless devices connect exclusively to the Wave® Wi-Fi Hotspot
	• Not designed to replace or function as a replacement internet router/ modem

	
The Wave® Smart Home solution reduces a households energy bills each month by providing users a better way to manage user energy which reduces overal consumption. The Technology also reduces a households internet bills each month by contributing to the cost of internet by paying the users ISP directly (and automatically). 

**The Home Hub™** experience can be improved even further by introducing other Wave® products, known as **Home Hub™ Enhancement Products**. The quantity and configuration of these enhancement products will depend on the size of the users home, occupants and their personal preferences.
