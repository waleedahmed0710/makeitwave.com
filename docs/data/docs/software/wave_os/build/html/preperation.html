<h1>Preperation &amp; Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#preperation-planning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This guide has been written to help you prepaire yourself and your home for Wave.
There is very little preperation and planning required with Wave, since it is intended to be a plug &amp; play solution.
This guide also presumes you have no technical knowledge and little knowledge of what to expect from our software and products, how the technology works or how to use it.</p>
<div class="section" id="expectations">
<h2>Expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#expectations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Obtaining Wave:</strong> - WaveOS™ is a free software which operates devices called Single Board Computers. More specifically the type know as: Raspberry Pi 3. WaveOS™ can be downloaded from our website for free. So if you have a Raspberry Pi already you can use and enjoy our technology without risking much.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a device, they can be purched from the official <a class="reference external" href="https://makeitwave.com">Wave® website</a>. The checkout accepts payment through Paypal. Your order will be immidiately passed to a UK distributor who will ship the product to you. The manufacturer of this hardware device is Sony and the delivery will include all cables and connectors needed to use and enjoy the product to its full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Up Wave:</strong> - After unboxing the device and ensuring the Micro SD Card is inserted(containing the latest version of WaveOS™), you must connect the device to your internet router using the Ethernet Cable provided and connect the Power Cable to the power outlet. You should also connect the HDMI Cable to a display if you wish to oversea the boot-up sequence.</p>
<p>It takes around 10 minutes for the device to boot up for the first time, so please be patience. Upon successful completion the device will be broadcasing the Wi-Fi SSID: wave-hotspot. Connect to this from any Wireless Device (phone, laptop etc), then open your web browser and type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.42.1</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://wave/</span></code> in the address bar.</p>
<p><strong>Our Hardware Solutions …</strong> a solution which will reduce your energy and internet bills each month. However it is important to understand that this is an end goal we are working towards which requires users of the technology to participate by procuring the technology, leaving it connected to internet and power.</p>
<p><strong>Our Team …</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Company …</strong> accountability. which we have to partners, shareholders, distributors, staff, inland revenue, postal service etc.</p>
<p><strong>Your Energy Company …</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Internet Service Provider …</strong></p>
<p>Our charter to make energy &amp; internet free is only a milestone of a bigger plan to make energy and internet an inalienable birth right (rather than an affordable privelage) for our next generation, so you need not tell us to hop to it, since we are already very motivated to achieve this both technologically, politically and in our capacity as humanitarians. So allow yourself a moment to come away from all the hype and marketing material which has brought you to this paragraph and lets give our saner heads a chance to prevail once again. We don’t want to have a single misunderstanding with you, since it’s us and you entering into a relationship here, so we take this opportuniy to manage your expectations of Wave® as we trust you will yourself.</p>
<p>We presume you’re smart, we consider ourselves smart too, so what we’d like at this first stage is to make sure you’re perfectly clear of what you’re getting with Wave. And hopeful give you a basic idea of how it all works if you don’t know already. We’d hate to think you’re running around worrying your friends and family into believing you’ve just gone mad or joined a cult. Equally we don’t want anyone claiming we’re riding off into the sunset with everyone’s hard earnt money, while you end up with a plastic box which does nothing for you. It’s better you do your homework now, establish some facts, then know for sure exactly what you’re getting yourself into with Wave, specifically since our technology may soon be entrusted to manage your internet, energy, entertainment, home and even your vehicles location depending on your level of trust in our technology.</p>
<p>The technology is still early stage, we won’t lie to you (it’s 2018 at the time of writing this). And technology can take months and even years to hit maturity. So please don’t hold your quality expectation as high as Facebook or Google’s products and service, which are supported with billions in revenue and hundreds of thousands of employees. The team behind Wave® is tiny and we’re a small ambitious startup. So this is ultimately a relationship between you and us, which could go on for many years if all goes well. We have had some great companies support us over these last few years and we sincerly seek the same long and prosperous relationship with our technologies users. Over the next few months and years we hope you’ll visualise our team working night and day to lower your utility bills every time you look at a utility bill or the device(s) around your home. Remembering that you bought the thing a while back and it’s not let you down since.</p>
<p>Sony Manufacture the Hardware in Pencoed in Wales, the physical technology is called a Single Board Computer, more specifically they’re Raspberry Pi’s. At the time of writing this there are 19million Single Board Computers in circulation and Wave’s is being developed for all kinds of these devices. But at this stage we are especially focused on the Raspberry Pi 3 until our user base reaches critical mass. So if you have one already then great, download WaveOS™ for free from <a class="reference external" href="https://makeitwave.com">our website</a>, and you’re good to go. If not, purchase a device through <a class="reference external" href="https://makeitwave.com">our website</a>, and we’ll get one sent out to you immidiately.</p>
<p>The free internet is achieved with a number of pioneering technologies. We currently use JSE Coin to mine cryptocurrency from reduntant processing power of devices you connect to Wave® to interface with the solution. We also use a technology called PiHole to perform ad-reinserSiôn, which getnerates advertising revenue. Ultimately you should not notice these two technologies, since you likely had no idea what adnetwork was serving ads to the websites you visited beforehand, and you likely had no knowledge of the redundant processing power of your personal devices e.g. laptop, phone, tablet, tv etc. In any case these funds autonomously collate into a single digital currency wallet corresponding to your specific devices unique processor ID. Then we use a technology called Bit-refill and Cryptocurrency Smart Contracts to autonomously transfer that balance to your Internet Service Provider each month. WaveOS™ uses your Public IP to determine who your buildings ISP is (not who you are) in order to automate payments to them each month. We call this whole set of intelligent systems: Surf-on-Wave.</p>
<p>The free energy is also achieved with several technologies but the methodology and whole approach is very difference. Your energy bill isn’t paid for in any way, Wave® actually just helps you lower consumption. We use OpenHaB in our software, so that you have full control of your homes wireless appliances, lights, plug sockets etc. And we use a technology called Dataplicity so that you can access these controls from anywhere. Wave® interfaces with a technology called Sense, which uses AI and crowdsourcing to determine what’s active in your home and what energy these devices consume. Optional extras may include Sensibo, which converts your AirConditionings Infrared Eye into Wi-Fi so it can work with Wave. We also grant access to multiple users, so your households co-habbitors can all monitor and control energy. Furthermore you can easily create logical rules, automation and it is this, all together, which saves your energy consumption and subsequently reduces your bills each month. If you have solar or wind and/or batteries, Wave® can also join the mix to improve production of enery.  We call this whole set of intelligent systems: Juice-on-Wave.</p>
<p>These little Single Board Computers are really very powerful, but WaveOS™ does test them to their limits. Never before has so many systems been run simultaniously on one device. Wave® really is like trying to run the pentagon from your watch. Or more ambitiously, upgrade everyones watches so we all have insane amounts of power at our finger tips. It was only a few years ago all of the technologies contained in Wave® was actually held on equitment which had to be liquid cooled and filled a 19” rack mountable cabinate, which has it’s own small room within a building. If Wave® were more intelligent it would make Shakespear look like it was written in crayon. And it would read it to you.</p>
<p>As a small disclaimer you should also be aware that none of what is being said here pertains to one specific product, but instead <a class="reference external" href="https://makeitwave.com">our product line</a>, as a whole. You can achieve much of what is being said with just the Wave® Home Hub™, which is a Single Board Computer running the <strong>Home Hub Edition™</strong> of WaveOS™ (Free to Download). But you may need a solution for monitoring the energy and extending its signal so that the LTE Home Hub™ can communicate with the Home Hub™. In this case multiple products and Software Editions will need to be in operation within your home - not just one plug &amp; play device.</p>

<p>As of 2018 and version 0.4.4 of WaveOS™ there is no issues obtaining a Single Board Computer, copying the Software to the Micro SD Card and inserting it into the device before powering it up:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first thing to expect is the device to become a Wi-Fi hotspot a few minutes after boot-up. You can then connect to it in order to view the main menu and select the Edition of the Software you’d like installed.</li>
<li>At this point everyone beta testing the technology is waiting for update 0.4.5 which will permit the first Edition to be installed. It is a one-click installation however we have disabled this for the moment to prevent anyone going further. We move forward together on this as a unit.</li>
<li>We aim to release version 0.4.5 and get going with this in December 2018. 0.4.5 is an upgrade, not an update. Which means the software will need to be re-downloaded and re-written to the Micro SD Card. But this is expected to be the last time you will need to do this for our convenience. The remainder of the upgrades will be done automatically over the internet. We already have this ability developed which you will notice during the boot up of version 0.4 if you have it hooked up to a monitor. It updates from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2 to 0.4.3 then 0.4.4.</li>
<li>Before 2019 the only Edition of WaveOS™ you will be able to select and install will be the <strong>Home Hub Edition™</strong>. But we are accepting orders for the various devices with the various editions installed.</li>
<li>Several of the applications for the <strong>Home Hub Edition™</strong> install autonomously and work great. Specifically the Media Center (Emby), IP Camera DVR (MotionEye) and Smart Home Control Application (OpenHaB). The vehicle tracking application and Energy Monitoring is still receiving our attention, as are the Vehicle Tracking and Energy Monitoring Editions, which power the devices which make these two solutions possible.</li>
<li>We have a Facebook Page where we welcome public discussions around this technology. We also welcome emails if you want a more private conversation or have any questions, queries or concerns. Our email address is <a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&#37;&#52;&#48;makeitwave&#46;com">info<span>&#64;</span>makeitwave<span>&#46;</span>com</a></li>
