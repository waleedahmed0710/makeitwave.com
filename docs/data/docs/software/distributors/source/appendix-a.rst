**The Wave Operating System (WaveOS)**

Introduction (In Laymens Terms)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WaveOS is a free and open source operating system powering a range of Plug & Play smart home solutions. WaveOS software transforms any Single Board Computer (circuit board) into a range of smart home devices which is determined by the user during intial installation. The options and solutions presented to the user include a Smart Home Hub, Wi-Fi Signal Booster, Media Storage Device, Multi-Room (Wi-Fi to HDMI) Link etc. And with added accessories such as GPS Antenna a Vehicle Tracker, or CT Clips to create an Energy Monitor. These modes of operation we call **Software 'Editions'**. 

When copied onto the memory of a Single Board Computer the software will self-configure as a Wi-Fi Hotspot after initial boot-up has completed. The user can then connect to the device and interface with the device to select a software edition and complete the installation, in much the same way we do with our Wi-Fi routers. For this to occur all that is required of the user is they provide power to the device and connect it to their routers ethernet port (so it has access to the internet). 

By making the solution self-build autonomously and presenting the user a user friendly interface (and choice of which Software Editions they would like to run) it has been possible to eliminate a previous need to have a technician configure and systems integrate the devices required to construct a Smart Home. 

Using WaveOS a non-skilled End-User is now able to use the exact same hardware and same software and generate for themselves, a wide range of smart home devices. In much the same way we have a mobile phone and a familiar operating system, running applications which transform our devices into a media center, game console etc - Wave does the same for the backbone technology devices that make our homes smart. WaveOS is freedom for anyone to produce their own products in their home, including re-arranging their hardware and interchanging the software editions to alter the devices purpose - all at their own discresion, with no programming skills required.  

WaveOS is a solution which removes the complexity out of producing a smart home which until now has required End-Users to purchase seperate hardware products, from seperate manufacturers, each with seperate software and interfaces (and/or commision a custom installers) in order to achieve the same objectives in almost every case. These objectives include multi-room media, smart home control, remote access, monitoring etc. 

A Single Board Computer with WaveOS installed and Home Hub Edition selected, will produce a Wave Home Hub Product. Equally a device with Energy Monitor Edition selected during initial installation, will product a Wave Energy Monitor Product. And so forth. By combining the products WaveOS produces it is possible to quickly assemble a complete **Wave Smart Home**, able to achieve most essential smart home functions including smart lighting, appliance and plug socket control, multi-room media etc.  

The theme and ultimate objective of WaveOS is to reduce energy and internet bills. Progress so far suggests energy and internet can actually become 100% free if the development of WaveOS continues on the path it's on. Embedded within the software are methods to achieving this end. The energy monitoring and home control applications, combined with the multi-user interface and remote access gives occupants of any household 

Technical Description (Summary)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WaveOS is a user-friendly operating system (no programming skills required) for single board computers, built on the work of DietPi and Raspbian Jessie (Linux). The source code is public and the software is free and acccesible from https://makeitwave.com/download.html

WaveOS achieve a low cost, fully connected smart in a matter of minutes. The underlying objective of this is a system designed to transition homes from paid internet and electricity to free internet and electricity e.g. freemium utilities. The even further underlying technology which achieves this is cryptocurrency-based monetisation technologies, which turns user activity in their home into revenue, which can be diverted to utility providers autonomously using smart contracts, resulting in reduced and perhaps free electricity and internet for homes. The specific embedded technologies involve cryptocurrency mining and ad-reinsersion. 

The margin between revenues generated from this model and what is paid to utility companies is expected to increase over time as the network grows, the technology improves and the current trends continue. Herein lies the Wave business model and market opportunity.  

The Operating System benefits End Users with Energy Monitoring, Smart Home Control, Media, IPCCTV and many more locally hosted and remotely accessible applications, all on a single menu/dashboard. 

Licenced Distributors will benefit from being able to source hardware, quickly and easily install this free Operating System onto it and set-up a pioneering solution for End User(s) for a fee of their choosing in a matter of minutes. Upselling and Cross Selling practically every smart home accessory, since WaveOS applications are compatible with most other peripheral systems for homes e.g. solar energy inverters, IPCCTV cameras, Smart Plug Sockets, Air Conditioning Systems, Wi-Fi Lighting etc.

For End-Users the cost of a fully connected, subscription-free smart home, with local and remote access, has reduced in price by a factor of 10 with the development of WaveOS for Single Board Computers (SBC’s). Benefits of this solution of rival solutions includes easy and cheap, modular replacement over time, easier understanding and day to day operation, lower energy consumption and a middle management system that seamlessly binds together practically every current and future technology for their home(s).
