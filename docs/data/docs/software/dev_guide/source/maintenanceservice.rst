Maintenance Services
=======================

Company shall provide to Distributor the "Maintenance Services" described in this Section 3.


New Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Company shall make available to Distributor all new releases and versions of the Product promptly upon completion thereof, including all modifications, error fixes, and associated documentation. Nothing contained herein, however, shall require Company to create any new releases and/or versions of the Product unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.


Error Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Company agrees that Company will use reasonable commercial efforts to correct all verifiable and reproducible "Errors". For the purposes of this Agreement, "Error" means a substantial failure of the Software to conform to the material functional specifications contained within the Documentation, and "Error Correction" means either a software modification or addition in Executable Code that when made or added to the Software, establishes material conformity of the Software to the material functional specifications contained within the Documentation, or a procedure or routine that, when included in the regular operation of the Software, eliminates the practical adverse effect on the End-User of such nonconformity. Upon delivery of an Error Correction to Distributor, such Error Correction shall be considered to be a part of the Software. Within a reasonable period of time after verifying that such an Error is present, Company shall initiate work in a diligent manner toward development of an Error Correction. Company shall not be responsible for correcting Errors resulting from misuse, negligence, revision, modification, or use of the Software or any portion thereof by Distributor, any End-User, or any other person or entity that is not in accordance with the license restrictions.  Distributor shall promptly notify Company of all reported Errors encountered by Distributor or to the extent known by Distributor, any End-User in using the Software.


Help Desk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Company agrees that Company will provide telephone, email and website ticket support to Distributor to report problems in the use of the Products and to seek assistance with regard to such problems during Company's normal business hours from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm GMT, as the case may be, weekends and bank holidays excepted. In no event shall Distributor provide access to such telephone support to End-Users or in any way refer such parties to Company prior to obtaining the written consent of Company.

Company Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Distributor may utilize web based, email and/or telephone based support for any Company issued Software and/or Product(s).  Company’s support personnel shall be trained and qualified to resolve Software problems.  Company’s support personnel will provide remote services, whereby Company will be able to access to Distributor’s and End-User(s) systems and provide the necessary assistance related to Distributor’s and/or End-Users use of Software.  During standard business hours of 9:00 AM thru 6:00 PM GMT, except holidays,   Company’s staff shall acknowledge to Distributor its reported problem or issue (collectively a “Problem”) within 24 hours of Distributor’s reporting to Company of any such Problem, that Distributor has experienced, and provide Distributor an estimated time to resolve or remedy such Problem.  Any Problem, which is acknowledged but not remedied within 10 working days of Distributor’s reporting to Company, shall be escalated to Company’s senior management.
