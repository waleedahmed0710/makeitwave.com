\subsubsection{2. License Grants and Conditions}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:license-grants-and-conditions}}
2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\theenumi{\alph{enumi}}
\def\labelenumi{(\theenumi )}
\makeatletter\def\p@enumii{\p@enumi (\theenumi )}\makeatother
\item {} 
under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
as part of a Larger Work; and

\item {} 
under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
Contributions or its Contributor version.

\end{enumerate}

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\theenumi{\alph{enumi}}
\def\labelenumi{(\theenumi )}
\makeatletter\def\p@enumii{\p@enumi (\theenumi )}\makeatother
\item {} 
for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
or

\item {} 
for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
version); or

\item {} 
under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
its Contributions.

\end{enumerate}

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.


\subsubsection{3. Responsibilities}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:responsibilities}}
3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\theenumi{\alph{enumi}}
\def\labelenumi{(\theenumi )}
\makeatletter\def\p@enumii{\p@enumi (\theenumi )}\makeatother
\item {} 
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

\item {} 
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

\end{enumerate}

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.


\subsubsection{4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:inability-to-comply-due-to-statute-or-regulation}}
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


\subsubsection{5. Termination}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:termination}}
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.


\subsubsection{6. Disclaimer of Warranty}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:disclaimer-of-warranty}}
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


\subsubsection{7. Limitation of Liability}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:limitation-of-liability}}
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.


\subsubsection{8. Litigation}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:litigation}}
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


\subsubsection{9. Miscellaneous}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:miscellaneous}}
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


\subsubsection{10. versions of the License}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:versions-of-the-license}}
10.1. New versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


\subsubsection{Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:exhibit-a-source-code-form-license-notice}}\begin{quote}

License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
file, You can obtain one at \sphinxurl{http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/}.
\end{quote}

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.


\subsubsection{Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:exhibit-b-incompatible-with-secondary-licenses-notice}}\begin{quote}

\subsection{Warranty Information}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:warranty-information}}

\subsubsection{Obtaining Services}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:obtaining-services}}
Wave® values your business and always attempts to provide you the very best of service. If this Product requires maintenance, either contact the dealer from whom you originally purchased the Product or visit our product support website at \sphinxurl{https://makeitwave.com} for information on how to obtain service or a Return Material Authorization (RMA). If it is determined that the Product may be defective, you will be given an RMA number and instructions for Product return. An unauthorized return (i.e., one for which an RMA number has not been issued) will be returned to you at your expense. Authorized returns must be shipped in an approved shipping container, prepaid and insured, to the address provided on your return paperwork. Your original box and packaging materials should be kept for storing or shipping your Wave® product.  Wave® shall have no liability for lost data regardless of the cause, recovery of lost data, or data contained in any Product placed in its possession.


\subsubsection{Limited Warranty}
\label{\detokenize{warranty:limited-warranty}}
Wave® warrants that the Product, in the course of its normal use, will for the term defined below, be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform to Wave’s specification therefor. The term of your limited warranty depends on the country in which your Product was purchased. The term of your limited warranty is for 3 years in the North, South and Central America region, 3 years in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and 3 years in the Asia Pacific region, unless otherwise required by law. The term of your limited warranty period shall commence on the purchase date appearing on your purchase receipt. Wave® shall have no liability for any Product returned if Wave® determines that the Product was stolen from Wave® or that the asserted defect a) is not present, or b) is attributable to misuse, improper installation, alteration (including removing or obliterating labels and opening or removing external enclosures, unless the product is on the list of limited user-serviceable products and the specific alteration is within the scope of the applicable instructions, as found at \sphinxurl{https://makeitwave.com}), accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than Wave, Wave’s licenced distributors and/or Wave’s End-User. Subject to the limitations specified above, your sole and exclusive warranty shall be, during the period of warranty specified above and at Wave’s option, the repair or replacement of the Product.

The foregoing limited warranty is Wave’s sole warranty and is applicable only to products sold as new. The remedies provided herein are in lieu of a) any and all other remedies and warranties, whether expressed, implied or statutory, including but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and b) any and all obligations and liabilities of Wave® for damages including, but not limited to accidental, consequential, or special damages, or any financial loss, lost profits or expenses, or lost data arising out of or in connection with the purchase, use, or performance of the Product, even if Wave® has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In the United States for example, some states do not allow exclusion or limitations of incidental or consequential damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from country to country.
