Special Permission(s) Request Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

(a)	In the event that Distributor desires to alter the Product or Product Marketing e.g. brand, source code etc, where it is for themselves, associates and/or End User(s), then Distributor shall deliver to Company a Special Permissions Request (a "Request Form"). The Request shall contain such information as Company may reasonably require from time to time in Company's sole discretion. Company's current Request For Quote is simply an email, addressed to info@makeitwave.com .  The effective date of the Request  (the "Special Permissions Request Registration Effective Date") shall be the date of the Request Notice, except as provided in the following sentence. In the event that Company does not respond to a Request from Distributor within 15 business days after receipt of a Request email, then the person or entity designated on such Request shall be deemed authorised and permitted, and the Registration Effective Date  shall be the 16th day after the date of receipt by Company of such Request. 

(b)	Company agrees that so long as a person or entity remains a Registered End User from the  labours of the Distributor, while this agreement is active, Company shall not unreasonably interfere with the relationship between the Distributor and Registered End User unless invited by either party. Both parties to this agreement acknowledge that Company intends, without any obligation of Company to Distributor whatsoever, to provide similar registration procedures and limitations with Company's other distributors, in order to prevent unnecessary bias or confuSi√¥n. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of Company to limit the marketing rights of any other Distributor or to create any third party rights in Distributor to enforce the terms and conditions of any agreement between Company and any third party distributor.

(c)	Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Company may establish requirements for prospective End Users to be granted Registered End User status and may deny Registered End User status to any prospective End User for any reason, including, without limitation, the previous granting of Registered End User status of such prospective End User to another distributor or Company's intentions to market to such prospective End User directly. Company will document and provide to Distributor the reason for business conflict. Company associates with regards development of the Product, may also do the same if they feel an End User is abusing their application and/or service contained within the Company's Product.
