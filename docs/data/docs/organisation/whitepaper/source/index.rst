Wave® Whitepaper
==================

Our Vision
-----------

We believe a powered and connected world is a better one. When you empower anyone with electricity and internet, their ability to contribute and generate value for their society, grows exponentially.  

Wave® is pleased to announce that we have developed a technology which profits from reducing users energy & internet bills each month. In some case studies we have seen bills reduce to zero. 

The Wave® solution is an Operating System we call WaveOS, which is part of a Patent Purchase Agreement with Google. So free energy & internet has become a reality.  

Wave® has created a small selection of plug & play products which run the Wave® Operating System. Avaliable for purchase from our website, with all the supporting documents including a Quick Start Guide, Operation Manuals, Warranty etc - https://makeitwave.com

The Source Code for WaveOS is open and public on GitHub for investigation and full transparency. The latest compiled software is also FREE to download from our website. So anyone already in possession of a Single Board Computer (such as the Raspberry Pi) can begin enjoying the benefits of Wave® immidiately.

Thank you for your time reading this. 
We've been Wave® and you've been great.
