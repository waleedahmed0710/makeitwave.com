Wave Interest Tokens (WIT)
================================

Wave® Interest Tokens™ (WIT Coins) were introduced for our Investors and Lenders as part of the Wave® Initial Coin Offering (ICO). 
The 2019 ICO also included the launch of two other Tokens: The Wave® Impact Notes™ (WIN) and Wave® Royalty Tokens™ (WRT). 
This document focuses on the Wave® Interest Tokens™. 

Wave® Interest Tokens™ generate an Annual Rate of Interest (APR) of 10%. 
Funds from WIT Coins help finance Wave® longer term projects and initiatives.  

WIT Coins are based on cryptocurrency Ethereum. Offering token holders freedom unlike anything a traditional currency and bank can provide.
