----------------------------------

Wave® Impact Notes (WIN) are a new cryptocurrency token released in 2019. 
WIN's are valued at £500 GBP each. 
The accounts also require a minimum deposit of £50 GBP per month to remain active. 
WIT & WRT Coins can be transfered into the WIN Account e.g. the cryptocurrencies can be exchanged.

Revenue from the Wave® Network was designed to distribute to ISP's then traditionally to WRT & WIT Coin Holders respectively through a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation). 
Wave® Impact Notes sit alongside the ISP's in the DAO configuration, giving Wave® Impact Notes higher priority access to advertising and mining revenue than WRT & WIT Coins.
