Wave makes internet a free birth-right for everyone.

Business Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wave is a new kind of effort which makes internet a free birth-right for everyone.
This charter presents real opportunity for global communities to fairer the distribution of their
resources; resulting in overall, improved living standards. Success in this field will mark the reach
of a new level in human development.

The previous level of human development was the industrial revolution. It allowed nations to
sustain. Prior to this we were in the agricultural age, where only cities and towns could be
sustained. Throughout all levels, a change in the economic system needed to occur in order it
evolve to be efficient enough for the new paradigm. The same economic shift is about to
happen as we near what is being deemed ‘the knowledge economy’. Although today’s advances
in technology warrant such a revolution, it hasn't happened yet. Paradoxically, this is the 21st
Century’s greatest challenge, but also a substantial opportunity.

Wave was formed in 2012 by a platoon of communications and cyber security experts from the
Royal Corps of Signals. This community has financed the early phase research and development
of a pioneering new network telecommunications platform which aims to revolutionise the way
we trade internationally, maintain social order and even manage our earth’s resources.
The platform facilitates a new generation of applications which could serve as a primary
alternative to our archaic systems of law, currency and even government. The research findings
and early phase technology is already an innovative accomplishment, both technologically and
philosophically. But where the technology truly innovates is in its ability to access everybody and
not just a privileged few.

Not only is the technology de-centralised but it offers networks and advertising better than
anything in existence. 


**Research**

Communities become as much as part of these systems as these systems become to
communities. Peoples trust and allegiance systematically shifts away from their instincts and
neighbours and into these archaic paper-based systems. The result is a very closed-off, selective
and controlling mindset. Agents of these systems regularly justify inhumane acts and work in
synchronicity to blockade, outlaw and enemize alternative social systems which threaten its
disempowerment.

Cyberspace is different. It brings us openness and transparency, making the entire environment
a power-leveller. Controversial virtual systems, such as BitCoin and WikiLeaks, have out-foxed
the fiat currency system and even our governmental system. Now Google's Dr Eric Schmidt is
telling us to expect the emergence of a philosophical and technical alternative to our entire
system of law. The phrase he coined for this system is 'Dual Crowdsourcing'. A virtual system
that allows anyone to report incidents up to the cloud and simultaneously allows jurors to pass
judgments down from the cloud. Collectively and anonymously in real-time.

Virtualised systems such as e-banking and government gateways seem to be methodical
enhancement of the old systems, but in actuality these cyber systems are just getting warmed
up. They are completely reinventing how we trade internationally, maintain social order and
manage resources. The new and old systems are already becoming notorious for locking horns
and contending at an ideological and philosophical level. As people move away from the old
systems and onto a new, we will witness one of the biggest global movement in over 5,000
years. A Cyber Civil War seems unfathomable but it will likely conclude in a matter of weeks or
even days. This is because of the immense traction that occurs in cyberspace. An example of this
is the game Angry Birds, which in 2012 gained 50 million subscribers in only 35 days. This is
more than the entire population of South Korea.

These examples show the very real possibility of a disruptive new system that could outperform
our system of money, law and government. And through the choice of the people, would also
outrank them. Since the emergence of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, we've also
developed a completely new mindset to tradition of institutional thinking. Thomas Powers
coined the phrase 'network thinking', which is the trans-human behaviour of openness,
randomness and supportiveness. This supports a claim the above claim that a proposed digital
economical system such as WAVE, could find it fast and frictionless to find its way into our
everyday lives.

**Development**

The first order of business in to transform digital communications, from an affordable privilege
to an individual’s free and inherent right. The technology is now in development.

Digital, decentralised currency helps democratise the monetary system, but by its very nature it
will still cause inequality. An improvement in efficiency for our modern era would be a
moneyless system which can, in real time, measure and balance an individuals’ social
contribution with a calculation of their level of access to their desired resource.

Publicising legal cases and making the courts accessible via the web helps modernise the legal
system, but laws can still be unlawful, subject to interpretation and enforced unconstitutionally.
Our system of law could become more efficient with a computerised system which can
collectively and anonymously, collect information about an incident, then in real-time that same
system can facilitate the passing of a judgement from a collective and anonymous source
Wave is pioneering in the field of telecommunications and digital advertising. Our revolutionary
technology platform makes it possible for internet service providers and mobile operators to
offer its customers a free mobile communication device and unrestricted service plans.

We are developing the right technology for the right market at the right time. For an emerging
multi-£billion market opportunity. Our business team have planned and prepared an innovative
technology and business model that can meet this challenge head on and exploit the market
opportunity. 

This concept will not only generate an extremely healthy ROI - it will also enable us to be at the
forefront of Corporate Social Responsibility at a global level, which will give our community the
opportunity to have an online voice and presence wherever and whoever they may be.

Making digital communications free is now technically possible and has now been proven with a
prototype technology developed by Wave Telecom. It eliminates the need to bill both home
and business users of any size for their internet usage as the high levels of targeted advertising
revenues mean we can not only cover these payments directly to the Internet Service Provider,
but also generate substantial profits after these costs are met.

This technology gained a firm position in several recent award ceremonies, including Cisco
British Innovation, Cyber Smart, Next Generation Digital Challenge and Digital Communications.
We are currently also entered into several awards for 2013 the outcomes of which shall be
announced later in the year.

During 2013 Wave Telecom Limited was incorporated and made principle trustee of the Extropy
Trust. The trust consists of a group of forward thinking telecommunications experts whom
research trends in future visions and finance the development of new era technologies.
This team has been developing, installing, maintaining and operating essential
telecommunications infrastructures and information systems for years, beginning their training
in The Royal Corps of Signals, which is now Britain’s most innovative force in cyber security and
defence in electronic warfare.

In accordance with the Trusts’ Charter, society’s biggest leap forward in the information age will
only occur once our ability to communicate digitally is transformed: “from an affordable
privilege to a free and inherent right”. It’s believed that this transformation alone will have
a more lasting positive impact than anything already experienced during the 21st
century. 

Wave Telecom now manages the entire commercial operation and this incorporation marks the
beginning of the final stages of a concept that has been 2 years in development. We will not
only bring this concept to market but also develop the technologies that will facilitate it, both in
the short and long term. Once phone calls, internet access and the devices that enable these 
benefits are made free to the individual, the entire world can interconnect at every level, all of
the time. 

Development of these technologies in cyberspace and telecommunications can immediately
benefit everybody in the world without restriction or prejudice. The entire philosophy of law,
currency and government will be able to evolve, making these frameworks of our society more
lawful; promoting equality and self-governance. 

So many of our day to day living expenses are on the increase to be able to not just reduce, but
fully eliminate, just one of these and enjoy the freedom to connect at zero cost would be
welcomed by both home and business users alike. But this is just the beginning.

Over the next 6 years we will be releasing some of the most innovative and state of the art
technology available in the world right now to the public in the UK and globally. Our aim is to
provide not only these technologies, but all other forms of communication such as mobile
phone use to our customers, cost free. We can also develop and provide our users with other
tools such as Wave social network, Wave search engine (with total cyber security), alternative
currency and social rating/scoring.

Our Wave technology development team is consistently 10 years ahead of their time with
theories, products, services and innovations. Instead of releasing these at a high cost to a select
few that can afford them - we will be turning this on its head and releasing to everyone for
zero cost

The products are available to anyone and cover the entire cross section of home and business
users. The list below shows just a few examples of our potential customers:

On release next year the process to sign up and use our product will be short and very simple.
- Go to the wave website www.wavetele.com
- Sign our terms and conditions
- Upload our software to any router
- Sign in through a Facebook account (until we offer our own “Wave” social network in
2015)
- Surf on the Wave platform

Wave Telecom will then meet the monthly bill costs for internet use by directly compensating
the ISP. The issues of wholesale cost and development of the payment procedure will be
agreed on with our Network Alliance ISP partners (see 3.2 “Types of Customer” for further
information on the Network Alliance).
On launch next year, all of these processes will have been rigorously tested by our
development team who will have created a seamless user experience.

The user will sign in initially through their Facebook account, but as we evolve our strategy is to
roll out our own search engine and social network. At the bottom of the screen the user will
see an unobtrusive banner on which targeted adverts will be shown and rotated every minute.

These adverts will be based on the user profile and therefore be relevant to the users’ product
or services preferences. An interactive online demo is available at www.wavetele.com/try.htm
These advertising campaigns, based on targeted relevant products and services, have been
trialled in case studies that form part of our previous research & development campaigns over
the past two years. The details of which shall be provided within this document, but suffice to
say, the success rate is better than any other advertising campaign running on the internet.
Both Facebook and Google’s advertising campaigns give a maximum click through rate of 2%.

The case studies of Wave Telecom produced a click through rate of up to 24% - a figure not
reachable to any other campaign today.
Wave Telecom advertising is therefore extremely valuable and provides the business with a
highly lucrative revenue stream. The details of which are available in the 3 year projections
attached.


Our technology has already received approximately £300k in development funding, and we are
now ready to begin the next stage of progressing the company towards launching our products
and services to the public with a seed funding round of investment.

Exit Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the launch of all of our technology outputs in 2016, the exit strategy for Wave
Telecom Limited is obtainable through 3 different options. Throughout the trading period we
shall be advised by our company legal team and company accountant as to the best option to
take and the optimum period to do it within based on our ROI and profit margin for the year.

Option 1 – Private Share Trading
Short term exit strategy Year 1-3
We have successfully offered our initial private investors the option to trade shares with new
investors as the business value increased through further investment into our technology and
R&D. As promised, all our investors have traded whenever they have needed and are happy
with the ROI received, even at the early stages of the business. Our aim is to offer this service
throughout the first 3 years of trading.

Option 2 – Merger/Acquisition/Friendly Takeover
Short term exit strategy Year 2-5
In an ideal world a perfect exit strategy for Wave would be to be part of a merger or acquisition
by another technology company or ISP. Our board of Directors would agree to this through a
public offer of stock or cash made by the acquiring firm, and the board of the target firm will
then publicly approve the buyout terms. Shareholder approval may be required dependent on
whether there any other shareholders other than directors at this point. The key determinant will
be whether the price per share offered is acceptable. Given the growth prospects of Wave, at
this point a premium figure would be expected.

Option 3 - Initial Public Offering (IPO)
Medium term exit strategy Year 3-5

“The first sale of stock by a private company to the general public on a securities exchange,
done by both smaller, younger companies seeking capital to expand or by largely privately
owned companies looking to become publicly traded”.
- Private Company -> Public Company
- Expansion capital raise
- Monetise investments of early private investors
- Become a publicly traded enterprise

Wave will employ the assistance of an underwriting firm (investment bank) to periodically advise
as to the best time to bring the company to market, the type of security to issue and the best
offering price. For those looking for a greater return from year 3 onwards, this may be a more
acceptable option.

Option 4 – Alternative Investment Market (AIM)
Medium Term Exit Strategy Year 3-5
Another option would be to float our shares on the AIM once the business is generating a
healthy profit (from year 3 – 5 onwards). This sub-market of the London Stock Exchange permits
smaller companies to participate with greater regulatory flexibility than applies to the main 
market (no set requirements for capitalisation or number of shares issued). As it is also the
London Stock Exchange’s global market for smaller and growing companies it would suit Wave
as an exit option. Early stage businesses, venture capital-backed companies and more
established businesses may also join AIM, so we are not limited in stage or timescales within the
first 5 years.
