A waiver by either of the parties hereto of any breach by the other party of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or the acquiescence of either party hereto in any act (whether commisSi√¥n or omission) which but for such acquiescence would be a breach as aforesaid, shall not constitute a general waiver of such term, provision or condition of any subsequent act contrary thereto.
