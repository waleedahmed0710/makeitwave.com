<h2>Company Indemnification<a class="headerlink" href="#company-indemnification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Company shall, except as otherwise provided below, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Distributor and its officers, directors and agents against any damages, costs, and fees resulting from:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>any third party claims that the Software or any of its elements or the use thereof in accordance with its related Documentation has, will or does violate or infringe any copyright, trade secret, or other valid  proprietary right of any other person or entity and</li>
<li>any failure on the part of Company to pay any taxes, duties or assessments Company is obligated to pay hereunder or other amounts Company is obligated to pay as set forth in Section 5.7. The right of indemnification as set forth herein will be subject to all of the following:</li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Distributor providing Company with prompt written notice of the initial claim and filing of the lawsuit relating thereto;</li>
<li>Distributor permitting Company to select legal counsel and to defend, compromise, or settle the lawsuit in the sole discretion of Company, except that Company shall have no authority to require Distributor to pay any amounts or admit to any wrong-doing;</li>

<li>if the use of the Software becomes, or in Company’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, Distributor permitting Company, at Company’s option and expense, either to procure the right for Distributor and End Users to continue to use the Software or to replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Company will have no liability for any infringement or misappropriation of any copyright, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights resulting from modification of the Software performed other than by Company, from use other than as specified under this Agreement and approved End User Agreement, and the related Documentation, or from the use of the Software with products not specifically approved in writing by Company for use with the Software. This Section 14 sets forth the exclusive remedy of Distributor against Company and the complete liability of Company with respect to any claim of infringement made against Distributor or any End User.</p>

<h2>Distributor Indemnification<a class="headerlink" href="#distributor-indemnification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to any other Distributor obligations of indemnity provided in this Agreement, Distributor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company, its affiliates, and their directors, officers, shareholders, employees and agents from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, causes of action or injuries, together with costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any claim by unaffiliated third parties arising out of or resulting from:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">

</ol>
<p>If  the use by Distributor of any symbol, insignia, name or identifying characteristic identifying the Products other than a Mark becomes, or in Distributor’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement under Section 14.2(b), Distributor shall, at Distributor’s option and expense, either to procure the right for Distributor to continue to use the symbol, insignia, name or identifying characteristic or to replace or modify the symbol, insignia, name or identifying characteristic  so that it becomes non-infringing. This Section 14.2 sets forth the exclusive remedy of Company against Distributor and the complete liability of Distributor with respect to any claim of infringement made against Company under Section 14.2(b).</p>
