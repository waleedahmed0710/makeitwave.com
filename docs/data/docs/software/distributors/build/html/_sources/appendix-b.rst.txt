Parts and Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the products section of the website you will see a 'Learn More' Tab, which opens the Package Content for each product. 
Distributors will be sent the list of parts detailed in this package content once an order is received from a prospective End-User in the Distributors region.  
The Distributor is expected to assemble the parts to produce a product and then post to the End-User. 
The Distributor will also be required to quality check the product and print and enclose the documentation. 

Here is a parts list for the HSPA+ Wave Home Hotspot:  https://makeitwave.com/store/product-detailed-info/3G.html
