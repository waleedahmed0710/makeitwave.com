<p>Wave® warrants that each hardware product that you purchase is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and conditions during the warranty period. If the product fails due to a covered defect during the warranty period, Wave® will provide you a remedy under this Limited Warranty. The warranty period for the product starts on the original date of purchase specified on your sales receipt or invoice unless Wave® informs you otherwise in writing. The warranty period and type of warranty service that apply to your product are set forth below in <strong>Part 3 - Warranty Service Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE BENEFITS GIVEN BY THIS WARRANTY ARE IN ADDITION TO YOUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AT LAW, INCLUDING THOSE UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW</strong>.</p>

<p>When warranty service involves the replacement of a product or part, the replaced product or part becomes Wave’s property and the replacement product or part becomes your property. Only unaltered Wave® products and parts are eligible for replacement. The replacement product or part provided by Wave® may not be new, but it will be in good working order and at least functionally equivalent to the original product or part. The replacement product or part shall be warranted for the balance of the period remaining on the original product. Products and parts presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished products or parts of the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair the product; and repair of the product may result in loss of data, if the product is capable of retaining user-generated data.</p>
