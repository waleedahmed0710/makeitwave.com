Requirement of Confidentiality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recipient agrees to hold the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner in confidence and not to, directly or indirectly, copy, reproduce, distribute, manufacture, duplicate, reveal, report, publish, disclose, cause to be disclosed, or otherwise transfer the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner to any third party, or utilize the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner for any purpose whatsoever other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Recipient shall protect the disclosed Proprietary Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the Proprietary Information as Recipient uses to protect its own proprietary or confidential information of a like nature.  With regard to the Trade Secrets, this obligation shall continue for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. With regard to the Confidential Information, this obligation shall continue for the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter. The foregoing obligations shall not apply if and to the extent that:

(a)	Recipient establishes that the information communicated was already known to Recipient, without obligations to keep such information confidential, at the time of Recipient's receipt from Owner, as evidenced by documents in the possession of Recipient prepared or received prior to disclosure of such information;

(b)	Recipient establishes that the information communicated was received by Recipient in good faith from a third party lawfully in possession thereof and having no obligation to keep such information confidential; or

(c)	Recipient establishes that the information communicated was publicly known at the time of Recipient's receipt from Owner or has become publicly known other than by a breach of this Agreement.

Section 11.2, Recipient agrees to implement the following security steps in order to protect the confidentiality and security of the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner:

(a)	Implement internal procedures to limit, control and supervise the use of the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner;

(b)	Make the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner available only to employees of Recipient who have executed written confidentiality agreements with Recipient;
