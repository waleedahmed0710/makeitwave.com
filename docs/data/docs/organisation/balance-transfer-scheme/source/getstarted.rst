Getting Started
###########################

Step 1 - Revolut Account Creation
====================================

To setup your Revolut Bank visit https://www.revolut.com/ and download the application to your mobile device.
Revolut will require you to take a photo of your passport and upload a selfi photo to confirm your identity. 

Step 2 - Top-Up & Virtual Card
====================================

The Revolut banking app will provide you with a sort code and account number so that you can deposit funds to your new account. 
You may also money transfer funds from credit cards. The goal of this scheme it to get your Revolut account balance as high as possible before submitting the balance to Wave® on or before the 16th August 2019. The more the balance, the more funds you will be able to release from your investment/ loan account. Before proceeding to step 3 you will need to generate a virtual bank card. 

Step 3 - Balance Confirmation
====================================

Next Wave® will confirm your Revolut account balance. 
Simply visit the link below and follow the onscreen steps: https://donorbox.org/check-balance


Your Revolut virtual bank card will be debited and credited to confirm the Revolut account balance. 
The form requires your main bank account details (preferably Revolut) so as the investment/loan can be deposited. 

Step 4 - Processing & Completion
====================================

The deadline for Step 3 is the 16th August 2019. The card merchant is Stripe, who take between 5 and 10 days to process the transaction. And a further 5-10 days to refund the transaction back to the card holder. In this time the financiers investment/ loan (equal to 90% of the confirmed Revolut account balance) will be deposited to their bank account submitted in the form in Step 3. All records will be re-published to the document section of our website in Septmeber 2019 to reflect the activity of this scheme.  

While waiting for these funds to process, please consider ordering a physical bank card and creating a virtual currency wallet (Ethereum) within your Revolut banking application.
