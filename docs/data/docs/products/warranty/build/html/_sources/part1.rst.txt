General Terms
=======================

This Wave® Limited Warranty applies only to Wave® hardware products you purchased for your own use and not for resale.

What this Warranty Covers
-----------------------------------

Wave® warrants that each Wave® hardware product that you purchase is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use during the warranty period. The warranty period for the product starts on the original date of purchase as shown on your sales receipt or invoice or as may be otherwise specified by Wave. The warranty period and type of warranty service that apply to your product are as specified in “Part 3 - Warranty Service Information” below. This warranty only applies to products in the country or region of purchase.

THIS WARRANTY IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTY AND REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AS SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES APPLY ONLY TO THE EXTENT AND FOR SUCH DURATION AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. AS SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ON DURATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


How to Obtain Warranty Service
-----------------------------------

If the product does not function as warranted during the warranty period, you may obtain warranty services by contacting Wave® or a Wave® approved Service Provider. A list of approved Service Providers and their telephone numbers is available at: https://makeitwave.com/distributors.html

Warranty service may not be available in all locations and may differ from location to location. Charges may apply outside a Service Provider's normal service area. Contact a local Service Provider for information specific to your location.


Customer Responsibilities for Warranty Service
----------------------------------------------------

Before warranty services are provided, you must take the following steps:
• follow the service request procedures specified by the Service Provider
• backup or secure all programs and data contained in the product
• provide the Service Provider with all system keys or passwords
• provide the Service Provider with sufficient, free, and safe access to your facilities to perform service
• remove all data, including confidential information, proprietary information and personal information, from the product or, if you are unable to remove any such information, modify the information to prevent its access by another party or so that it is not personal data under applicable law. The Service Provider shall not be responsible for the loss or disclosure of any data, including confidential information, proprietary information, or personal information, on a product returned or accessed for warranty service
• remove all features, parts, options, alterations, and attachments not covered by the warranty
• ensure that the product or part is free of any legal restrictions that prevent its replacement
• if you are not the owner of a product or part, obtain authorization from the owner for the Service Provider to provide warranty service
   

What Your Service Provider Will Do to Correct Problems
--------------------------------------------------------

When you contact a Service Provider, you must follow the specified problem determination and resolution procedures. 

The Service Provider will attempt to diagnose and resolve your problem by telephone, e-mail or remote assistance. The Service Provider may direct you to download and install designated software updates. 

Some problems may be resolved with a replacement part that you install yourself called a “Customer Replaceable Unit” or “CRU.” If so, the Service Provider will ship the CRU to you for you to install. 

If your problem cannot be resolved over the telephone; through the application of software updates or the installation of a CRU, the Service Provider will arrange for service under the type of warranty service designated for the product under **Part 3 - Warranty Service Information** below. 

If the Service Provider determines that it is unable to repair your product, the Service Provider will replace it with one that is at least functionally equivalent. 

If the Service Provider determines that it is unable to either repair or replace your product, your sole remedy under this Limited Warranty is to return the product to your place of purchase or to Wave® for a refund of your purchase price.


Replacement Products and Parts
---------------------------------

When warranty service involves the replacement of a product or part, the replaced product or part becomes Wave’s property and the replacement product or part becomes your property. Only unaltered Wave® products and parts are eligible for replacement. The replacement product or part provided by Wave® may not be new, but it will be in good working order and at least functionally equivalent to the original product or part. The replacement product or part shall be warranted for the balance of the period remaining on the original product.

Use of Personal Contact Information
--------------------------------------

If you obtain service under this warranty, you authorize Wave® to store, use and process information about your warranty service and your contact information, including name, phone numbers, address, and e-mail address. Wave® may use this information to perform service under this warranty. We may contact you to inquire about your satisfaction with our warranty service or to notify you about any product recalls or safety issues. In accomplishing these purposes, you authorize Wave® to transfer your information to any country where we do business and to provide it to entities acting on our behalf. We may also disclose it where required by law. Wave's privacy policy is available at https://makeitwave.com/

Limitation of Liability

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), DAMAGE TO REAL PROPERTY OR DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY FOR WHICH Wave® IS LIABLE UNDER LAW.
