\chapter{APPENDIX A \textendash{} Description of Software}
\label{\detokenize{appendix-a:appendix-a-description-of-software}}\label{\detokenize{appendix-a::doc}}
\sphinxstylestrong{The Wave® Operating System (WaveOS™)}


\section{Introduction (Laymens Terms)}
\label{\detokenize{appendix-a:introduction-laymens-terms}}
WaveOS™ is a free and open-source software. The purpose of WaveOS™ is to make Energy \& Internet Free. The software operates on a wide range of hardware devices known as Single Board Computers. Wave® transforms these devices into a wide range of smart home solutions, all able to reduce the users energy \& internet bills each month.

The list of smart home functions WaveOS™ can perform includes a \sphinxstylestrong{Smart Home Hub™} (with media center, camera monitor and IoT home control), a Wi-Fi Signal Booster™, a Media Storage Device and a Multi-Room (Wi-Fi to HDMI) Link etc. And with added accessories such as GPS Antenna or CT Clips Wave® can even transform the device into a (Mobile Carrier-Free) Vehicle Tracker or Energy Monitor™. What the device does is determined by the user during intial installation. The options presented to users are named \sphinxstylestrong{Software ‘Editions’} e.g. \sphinxstylestrong{Energy Monitor Edition™}, \sphinxstylestrong{Home Hub Edition™} etc

After Wave® has been copied onto the memory of a Single Board Computer and the device booted-up, the software will autonomously transform the device into a Wi-Fi Hotspot. The user can then connect to the device and interface with it in order to select a software edition and complete the installation, in much the same way as a Wi-Fi router. All that is required of the user is they provide power to the device and connect it to their routers ethernet port (so it has access to the internet). Other than a prompt to select a Software Edition, the installation is completely automatic. By making the solution self-build autonomously and presenting the user a friendly interface, it has been possible to eliminate the need to commisSiôn an engineer to configure, integrate and/or construct your Smart Home.

Using WaveOS™ a non-skilled End-User is now able to use the exact same hardware and same software to generate for themselves, a wide range of smart home devices. In much the same way we have a mobile phone and a familiar operating system, running applications which transform our devices into a media center, game console etc - Wave® does the same for the devices required to make our homes smarts and most of all our energy \& internet free. WaveOS™ is freedom for anyone to produce their own smart home products within their home, including re-arranging the hardware and interchanging their roles, at the users own discreSiôn, with no programming skills required.

WaveOS™ is a solution which removes the complexity out of producing a smart home, which until now has required End-Users to purchase seperate hardware products, from seperate manufacturers, each with seperate software and interfaces (and/or commisSiôn a custom installers) in order to achieve the same objectives in almost every case. These objectives include multi-room media, smart home control, remote access, monitoring and lower energy bills.

A Single Board Computer with WaveOS™ installed and \sphinxstylestrong{Home Hub Edition™} selected, will produce a Wave® Home Hub™ Product. Equally a device with \sphinxstylestrong{Energy Monitor Edition™} selected during initial installation, will product a Wave® Energy Monitor™ Product. And so forth. By combining \sphinxstylestrong{the products} WaveOS™ produces, it is possible to quickly assemble a complete \sphinxstylestrong{Wave® Smart Home} - able to achieve many essential smart home functions including smart lighting, appliance/ plug-socket control, multi-room media etc.

The theme and ultimate objective of WaveOS™ is to reduce energy and internet bills. Progress so far suggests energy and internet can actually become 100\% free if the development of WaveOS™ continues on the path it’s on. Embedded within the software are methods to achieving this end. The Energy Monitoring and home control applications, combined with the multi-user interface and remote access, gives occupants of any household 24/7 full home monitoring and controls, wherever they are. The solution also allows scheduling and rule based home controls, so no more excuses for accidently leaving lights and tv’s on.


\section{Technical Description (Summary)}
\label{\detokenize{appendix-a:technical-description-summary}}
WaveOS™ is a user-friendly operating system (no programming skills required to operate it). Built on the work of DietPi and Raspbian Jessie (Linux) and designed to run on single board computers  like the Raspberry Pi. The source code is public on GitHub and the compiled software is free and available for worldwide download from \sphinxurl{https://makeitwave.com/download.html}

Wave® can establish a low cost, fully connected smart home in a matter of minutes. The underlying objective of this is a system designed to transition homes from paid internet and electricity to free internet and electricity. The even further underlying technology which achieves this is cryptocurrency-based monetisation technologies, which turns user activity in their home into revenue, which can be diverted to utility providers autonomously using smart contracts, resulting in reduced and perhaps free electricity and internet for homes. The specific embedded technologies involve cryptocurrency mining and ad-reinserSiôn.

The margin between revenues generated from this model and what is paid to utility companies is expected to increase over time as the network grows, the technology improves and the current trends continue. Herein lies the Wave® business model and market opportunity.

The Operating System benefits End Users with Energy Monitoring, Smart Home Control, Media, IPCCTV and many more locally hosted and remotely accessible applications, all on a single menu/dashboard.

Licenced Distributors will benefit from being able to source hardware, quickly and easily install this free Operating System onto it and set-up a pioneering solution for End User(s) for a fee of their choosing in a matter of minutes. Upselling and Cross Selling practically every smart home accessory, since WaveOS™ applications are compatible with most other peripheral systems for homes e.g. solar energy inverters, IPCCTV cameras, Smart Plug Sockets, Air Conditioning Systems, Wi-Fi Lighting etc.

For End-Users the cost of a fully connected, subscription-free smart home, with local and remote access, has reduced in price by a factor of 10 with the development of WaveOS™ for Single Board Computers (SBC’s). Benefits of this solution of rival solutions includes easy and cheap, modular replacement over time, easier understanding and day to day operation, lower energy consumption and a middle management system that seamlessly binds together practically every current and future technology for their home(s).
