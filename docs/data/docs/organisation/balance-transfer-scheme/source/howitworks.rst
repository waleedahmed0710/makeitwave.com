How it Works
#################################################

Wave® and its financiers both have various forms of credit facilities avaliable. This scheme uses these credit facilities in conjunction with each other to return investments and loans to Wave® financiers by September 2019. 

In the case of Wave®, the company has excellent credit with its card merchants e.g. Stripe, Paypal etc. Following the rare circumstance where a card payment is taken and a refund is made, a situation is created where both the card holder and Wave® are simultaniously in receipt of the payment. This is because the card merchant uses their own capital to process the refund then recouporates the amount later by deducting it from future card payments before they reach Wave®. 

In the case of Wave's financiers, credit is avaliable to them in various other forms e.g. loans, credit cards etc. Traditionally this opportunity is not fully explored due to high-rates of interest or limited requirement for borrowing due to alternative funding sources e.g. savings, salary etc. But transfering these lines of credit from a high interest lender to lower interest lenders is a sound act and known as a balance transfer. The goal for the financier will be to get their Revolut account balance to exceed their investment/ loan to Wave® before the closing submission date of this scheme. Once Wave® has confirmed the balance with a Credit/Debit transaction, 90% of the amount confirmed will be taken from the Wave® Investment/ Loan account of the financier and released to their Revolut account, all before the 1st September 2019. 

The benefit to Wave® is that it simultaniously recouperates some equity and liberates itself from the compounding high rates of interest it currently provides its investors and lenders. However the funds being returned to the financiers is not from Wave® releasing working capital, instead Wave® is systematically transfering its obligations from seed fund financiers to its card merchants. As of September 2019 Wave® will (in full or in part) be indebted to its card merchant(s) and not its origional financier. The liability to the card merchants is 0% APR as oppose to the 10 - 22.5% APR currently compounding on the accounts of private investors/ lenders. 


Example 
***********

In the example below a financier has loaned Wave® £10,000 GBP. The financier also has access to a further £10,000. In addition Wave® has access to £10,000 from its own 3rd party lender, in this case its card merchant.  Wave® withdraws and refunds the financiers avaliable balance, which can be credit but not a requirement, creating a situation where Wave's card merchant willingly incurs liabiliy while Wave® is in a position of positive credit. Less the card transaction fees Wave® then transfers this positive credit to the finacier. Wave® is then liable to Stripe and not the financier.
