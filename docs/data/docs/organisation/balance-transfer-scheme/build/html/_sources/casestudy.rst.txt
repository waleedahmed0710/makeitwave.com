Case Studies
###############

In the last two years Wave® has issued a total of only four refunds of any purposeful amounts. In all these instances the funds were returned to the cardholder using the capital of the card merchant and not Wave®. These transactions prove the theory behind this scheme, not withstanding the timescales. The balance confirmation detailed in Step 3 of the 'Getting Started' section, will perform a debit and credit (refund) much faster than the timescales of the examples below. The expectation is between 5 and 10 days, providing Step 3 is completed before the closing date of this scheme:


**Eddy Van-Tricht** paid $1,050.00 USD to Wave® on the 13th March 2018 and was refunded on the 11th May 2018 using the card merchant Stripe. 


**Johnny Choudhury-Lucas** paid £1,483.13 GBP to Wave® on the 3rd April 2018 and was refunded on the 29th April 2018 using the card merchant Stripe.


**Leyda Roa** paid $400 USD to Wave® on the 3rd September 2018 and was refunded by the 27th September 2018 using the card merchant Paypal. 


**Elizabeth Coldwell-Hall** paid £400 GBP to Wave® on the 23rd July 2019 and was refunded on the 9th August 2019 using the card merchant Paypal.
